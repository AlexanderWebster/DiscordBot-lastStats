# DiscordBot-lastStats

## Description
> A lightweight Discord bot that retrieves stats for the last League of Legends game played. 

## Usage

In a discord channel, type **!last (username)** to fetch your stats.

*--currently restricted to NA players due to region constraints--*

## In Action!

## Further

Based on which game(s) my friend group is currently playing, I plan to continue to add helpful modules like this to one main Discord bot that will permanently inhabit my home Discord server.
